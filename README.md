## This is a simple tool to help with OLED monitor care in **MULTI-MONITOR** setups.  
### This is an application that sits in the taskbar and when the mouse leaves the selected screen, that screen dims/blacks out. When the mouse moves back to the screen it fades back in.  
### Right click the icon(sheild) in the taskbar and click settings to set the monitor you want to dim for protection, full blackout/dim level, and if it should start with windows. The dim level is the amount to dim it, not the final percentage.  For example 80% means the screen will go to 20% brightness.  
# WHEN ENABLING START WITH WINDOWS: Windows will try to start it where you originally ran it from, so put it in a folder you don't plan on moving!
### As of now it is only meant to dim/blackout 1 connected screen since I only have one OLED screen in my particular setup(OLED laptop with 2 IPS monitors connected).
### There is also a test button that will demonstrate the results for 10 seconds.
### I can't see how this would be useful in a single monitor setup.  
As a sidenote, I haven't written a program for windows in over 20 years and out of all the programming languages I have used, I have never used c#. I made this in about 2 hours with the help of Gemini 3.0 and have not cleaned it up and there are probably things that are less than ideal.  Having said that, it seems to work great on my laptop.
